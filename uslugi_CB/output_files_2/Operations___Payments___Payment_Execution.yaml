    title: CreditPaymentDistribution
    description: Calculated or requested credit payment distribution. It is returned
      as the result of calculation of the next credit repayment. It also may be used
      to point the different distribution when the repayment is requested. When used
      in the repayment request, non read-only attributes should be properly set. The
      complete set of amount ingredients should be provided (the sum of repayment),
      missing ingredients are assumed to be 0. If the payment distribution contains
      amount ingredients, the requested amount of repayment outside the distribution
      cannot be used (it may raise the amount inequality conflict). The other attributes
      may be used to override some aspects of the repayment behaviour.
